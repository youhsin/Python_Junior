# Hypothesis Testing With Python

In an experiment, the averages of the control group and the experimental group are 169.61 and 169.88. Is the experimental group better than the control group? Or is the difference just due to the noise?

In this talk, I will introduce statistical hypothesis testing to rule out the noise. Moreover, Python-based visualization, calculation, and simulation of various topics will be demonstrated, including α, β, effect size, sample size, inverse α (false discovery rate), and inverse β (false omission rate).
